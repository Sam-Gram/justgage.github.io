These are things that I think every Programmer should check out:

# Talks

- [Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy): If you do nothing else on this page **watch this talk!!!**
- [Value of Values](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values) makes you think twice everytime you modify a variable in place. 
- [JavaScript: the good parts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook): There's a very good chance that you're going to be writing some JavaScript sometime in your life. 'bout time you learned what it really is. 

# Programming Styles

- [Functional Programming](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/dont-be-scared-of-functional-programming/): It will change the way you think about code forever. NOTE: This blog post isn't perfect but I haven't found anything better yet.

# Frameworks

- [Phonix Framework](phoenixframework.org): A Rails like web framework that is _far faster_. Written in Elixir.
- [Love2d](love2d.org): A game Frameworks that is the first one I've found that _isn't_ Object Oriented.

# Languages

- [Elm Lang](elm-lang.org): no runtime exceptions? Enforcing symantic versioning? Friendly Complier Messages? Yes Please!
- [Elixir](elixir-lang.org): The most friendly functional language
- [Prolog](swi-prolog.org): This one will _bend your mind!_. 
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/): It's everywhere, and it can be really good so long as you _do not_ use inheritance or any sort in it.
    - [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) This is the best framwork for JavaScript hands down. Far simpler than Angular and far easier to test then just about anything.
- [Go](golang.com): Perhaps one of the best Languages focused on _less_ features. Great cocurrency. And `go fmt` is genious.

# Databases

- [Datomic]( www.datomic.com ): You might just realize that not having an Immutable database is insanity. Sadly not free for comercial projects.

# Books

- [7 Languages in 7 Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks). A great way to get introduced to lots of different programming styles

# Editors

- Vim: Because it's just awesome
- Emacs: So you can know what all the hype is abut. 

# OS

- Linux: If you haven't had Linux on your computer once. You need to
    - AweomeWM: this is a cool tiling window manager. Read up on the keybindings before you try
